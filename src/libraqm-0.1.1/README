Raqm
====

Raqm is a small library that encapsulates the logic for complex text layout and
provide a convenient API.

It currently provides bidirectional text support (using [FriBiDi][1]), shaping
(using [HarfBuzz][2]), with proper script itemization. By the virtue of this,
Raqm can support most writing systems covered by Unicode.

This is an early prototype and is still work in progress. We try to not break
the API and ABI needlessly, though.

The documentation can be accessed on the web at:

Raqm (Arabic: رَقْم) is writing, also number or digit and the Arabic word for
digital (رَقَمِيّ) shares the same root, so it is a play on “digital writing”.
